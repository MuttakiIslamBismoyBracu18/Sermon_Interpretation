when uploading, can we do a progress bar?

Can we do a filtering when showing the timestamps? 
For the graph sure show all the points but if for a timestamp all emotions match then 
fade those dots but if 3 or two emotions are different, maybe bold or highlight those timestamps?

Can we also hoghlight rapid changes in emotions? Like happy to angry suddenly or stuff like that? 
Identify some rapid changes and highlight those as well?
